Dear Crush,
I’ve been keeping this in for a while, but I think Valentine’s Day is the perfect time to say it—you’re the reason my days feel brighter. Every little moment with you means more than I can put into words. Your smile, your laughter, the way you make everything feel lighter—it all makes my heart race in the best way possible.

So, here it is... I like you, a lot. Maybe even love. Would you be my Valentine? No matter your answer, I just wanted you to know how special you are to me. You’ve filled my heart with warmth in ways I never expected, and for that, I’m grateful. But if you say yes, I promise to make every day feel like Valentine’s Day for you—to cherish you, to make you smile, and to remind you just how much you mean to me.

With Love,
Your Admirer
